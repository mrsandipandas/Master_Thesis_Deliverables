	This thesis work introduces a new way of tuning optical polarization. The tuning is done using micro electro-mechanical (MEMS) systems by rotating waveguide structure, which changes the effective refractive index of the waveguide. To measure the performance of the system, polarization extinsion range and the device dimension required for optical polarization are presented. An automated measurement setup is used from polarization rotation from TE to TM mode or vice. The system is compared to current state of art.
