	This thesis work introduces a new way of tunable optical polarization. The tuning is done using micro electro-mechanical systems by rotating waveguide structure, which changes the effective refractive index. In this report we calculate the polarization extinsion range and the device dimension required for optical polarization. To explain how well the process works we present an automated measurement setup measuring polarization rotation from TE to TM mode or vice versa.
