The idea of electrically controllable optical polarization rotation utilizing \gls{mems} in silicon photonics establishes new horizons for on-chip integrated photonics. In addition to polarization rotators, dynamic control of optical polarization rotation can be utilized to realize a new class of components in integrated photonics including polarization mode modulators, multiplexers, filters, and switches for advanced optical signal processing, coherent communications, and sensing. Advanced sensors can be designed since more spectrometric analysis can be done using tunable modes. The \gls{tpr} can also be used for developing integrated polarization stabilizer, \gls{pmd} mitigation, \gls{pdl} mitigation and \gls{pmd} and \gls{pdl} measurement systems. Also, since the power consumption of the \gls{tpr} is very low, this can be used for reconfiguration of network topology at low power. Furthermore, the concept can be useful in situations where polarization tuning is necessary under adiabatic conditions e.g. in photon entanglement. Photon entanglement promises  the development of even smaller micro-electronic devices along with secure communication channels, which can be very helpful in the future. In addition the \gls{tpr}, in this thesis work a free standing \gls{pbs} of length \SI{1.4}{\micro \meter} is designed which can be helpful in spectrometric analysis of deconfined modes. Also, in this thesis a test setup with grating couplers, \gls{te} and \gls{tm} tapers, \gls{pbs} is developed which can be used further to evaluate integrated photonic components with smaller mode sizes.
